# Multi-Label Long Text Classification
A simple implement for multi-label text classification with Bert. I will extend the code to a higher version for very long text over 512, which is the longest input sequence of Bert.

I also implement it with XLNet offered by https://github.com/huggingface/transformers , which can process longer text, but it takes longer computation time.
